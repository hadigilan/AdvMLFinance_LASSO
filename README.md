This repository provides the required files for tutorial 1 (LASSO with R) for the course Advances of Machine Learning in Finance (ACCFIN5229), 
at Adam Smith Business School, at the University of Glasgow, 2022-23.

# R code
We use the glmnet function from glmnet package to run LASSO regression in R. We have two examples to show the results of this function and interpretation:
1) An artificial data to illustrate variable selection results and draw the solution (or regularization) path 
2) A real data to show the applicability of the LASSO in finance

# The PwerPoint file
There is a short review on LASSO theory and R programming.
