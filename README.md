# LASSO
This repository provides materials on the LASSO theory and its application in finance --- has been used in the course Advances of Machine Learning in Finance (ACCFIN5229), at ASBS, University of Glasgow, 2022-23.

# R code
We use the glmnet function from glmnet package to run LASSO regression in R. We have two examples to show the results of this function and interpretation:
1) An artificial data analysis to illustrate variable selection results and draw the solution (or regularization) path 
2) A real data analysis to show the applicability of the LASSO in finance

# The PwerPoint file
There is a short review on LASSO theory and R programming.

# Google Sheet
The LASSO created a new path in the world of variable selection, and model fitting. In this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MSrK9J_LY4USCosxjmCCPW6U2sEnZw0LuaeUOV_FumE/edit?usp=sharing), we introduce LASSO-related methods (mostly variable selection methods) which have close connection with it.
